CJDLOG(1)
===========
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
cjdlog - Information about your cjdroute setup and instance.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*cjdlog* [make|clear|clear-old|clear-new|watch]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
cjdlog(1) is a parallel logging utility, so that cjdroute output
can be duplicated in two places: a "current process" log at
/var/log/cjdns/cjdroute.current.log, and an all-time log at
/var/log/cjdns/cjdroute.log. 


EXAMPLES
--------
*cjdlog*::
    Logs stdin to both log files in parallel. You must be user
    cjdns or root. In general, this is called by cjdrouted, and
    not something you have to worry about. If you are starting
    cjdrouted manually, pipe it into cjdlog, redirecting output
    with 2>&1 before the pipe symbol.

*cjdlog* make::
    Create the folder, ensure log files exist (even if just blanks)
    and change file ownership to owner cjdns. May be necessary to
    call before attempting to log any data.

*cjdlog* clear::
    Clear both log files.

*cjdlog* clear-old::
    Clear the all-time log file at /var/log/cjdns/cjdroute.log.

*cjdlog* clear-new::
    Clear the current-process log file at /var/log/cjdns/cjdroute.current.log.

*cjdlog* watch::
    Write out log file data as it's written. Internally it's just a tail -f. Note that
    thanks to the nature of buffers and flushing, this data may come in bits and pieces,
    and look like it's cutting out in the middle of lines. This is irritating but to be
    expected.

CJCONF-ADD(1)
===========
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
cjconf-add - manipulates peer information in cjdroute configs.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*cjconf-add* [ conf_file ] [ merge_source ]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
cjconf-add(1) has two modes: interactive, and merge. With 0 or 1 arguments,
it uses interactive mode, letting you add, update, and remove peers over the
command line (using /etc/cjdroute.conf as the default conf file to edit if it's
not given).

Supplying 2 arguments will go into merge mode, where a composite config is created,
using the main config as a base and adding in all the peers from the merge_source
file. This means it retains all the other options in the original file. Unlike
in interactive mode, where your meddling is saved for you every time you make a
change, merge mode spits out the resulting JSON of the merge to STDOUT.


EXAMPLES
--------
*cjconf-add*::
    Interactively edits /etc/cjdroute.conf.

*cjconf-add* myconf::
    Interactively edits myconf, which resides in the working directory.

*cjconf-add* /etc/cjdroute.conf /etc/cjdroute.conf.default > /etc/cjdroute.conf::
    This is the source code to cjconf-add-default. No, really. It creates a
    composite config using the peers in /etc/cjdroute.conf.default (a set of
    public peers included in the cjdns package) and the current config, retaining
    the settings and peers of the original, and writes the output back to the main
    config file.

    CAUTION: It's important to note that in the actual cjconf-add-default, a temporary
    intermediate file is used, because otherwise the shell erases /etc/cjdroute.conf
    before it starts reading it into cjconf-add. In other words, DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.
    Always use a temp file in between if you're overwriting the original.

CJDINFO(1)
===========
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
cjdinfo - Information about your cjdroute setup and instance.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*cjdinfo* [commands|tunnel|address|key]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The cjdinfo(1) command is useful for finding out the key details
of your cjdroute instance and setup. It was born out of a need
to move functionality out of cjdroute for simplicity, and have a
place to add informative more informative subcommands as the author
saw fit.


SUBCOMMANDS
-----------
*commands*::
    The commands that need to be run to connect the tunnel device
    to the network interface, and allow cjdroute to provide that
    service. Used by (and formerly, in) cjdrouted.

*tunnel*::
    Create a tunnel if no appropriately configured one exists, and
    return its name. Useful in scripts. Also a cjdrouted refugee.

*address*::
    The IPv6 address of your cjdroute instance. Currently it requires
    you to be running, or have run, cjdroute through cjdrouted. That's
    because it determines your address based on the logs. However, at
    some point in the future this will be changed to be based on the
    result of "cjdinfo commands".

*key*::
    The public key of your cjdroute instance. Like the address subcommand,
    it is log-based, and requires log information in /var/log/cjdns/cjdrouted.current.log.
    Unlike the address subcommand, this is impossible to fix.

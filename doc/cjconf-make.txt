CJCONF-MAKE(1)
==============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
cjconf-make - Generate a cjdroute conf if none exists.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*cjconf-make*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
cjconf-make(1) checks whether a file with a length greater than
zero exists at /etc/cjdroute.conf. If not, it uses cjdroute to 
create one. It takes no arguments, and is very simple.

If your config is messed up or you want a new one, you delete the
old file with cjconf-remove(1) and then re-run cjconf-make.

EXAMPLES
--------
*cjconf-make*::
    Builds a new config at /etc/cjdroute.conf if none exists, or
    the file is empty.

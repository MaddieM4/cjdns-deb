CJCONF-GET(1)
===========
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
cjconf-get - retrieves information from a cjdroute config.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*cjconf-get* [-n] [ -f conf_file ] [ INDEXES ]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
cjconf-get(1) is a great way to base scripting on cjdns configs. It parses the
JSON recursively, with each index given in the arguments steering it one level
of heirarchy deeper.

To limit output, try the -n option. For dicts, it prints only the keys. For arrays,
it prints out the length. For anything else it just prints it normally.

EXAMPLES
--------
*cjconf-get*::
    Since it assumes the conf is at /etc/cjdroute.conf when not otherwise specified,
    this is equivalent to cjconf-print.

*cjconf-get* -n::
    Prints out the name of every property in the top level of the config.

*cjconf-get* -f myconf::
    Prints the entirety of the JSON at the location "myconf". Again, without using
    indexes, this is very much like the more basic cjconf-print. Because the "-f filename"
    tuple is removed from the argument list during processing, it can occur at any time within
    the arguments, provided it only occurs once.

*cjconf-get* router interface::
    Prints the contents of config["router"]["interface"]. If this is a string or int,
    it will be printed out directly, with no JSON formatting. Otherwise, it's pretty-printed
    with an indent width of 4 spaces, like usual.

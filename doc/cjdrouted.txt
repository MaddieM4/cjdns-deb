CJDROUTED(1)
===========
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
cjdrouted - Daemon control over cjdroute.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*cjdrouted* [start|stop|reconfigure|start-default|killtunnel]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The cjdrouted(1) command provides shortcuts for manipulating the cjdroute
process, as well as creating and destroying tunnel devices.


SUBCOMMANDS
-----------
*start*::
    Make sure /etc/cjdroute.conf exists, use it to run cjdroute, and
    log it all to both log locations using cjdlog.

*stop*::
    Kill the daemon process. Simply a call to `killall cjdroute`, so if
    you're one of those brave/strange people who want to run multiple
    instances on the same OS... yet another reason cjdrouted will not
    get along with your multi-noding fringe behavior. Don't get me wrong,
    though, you can do this in VMs just fine, but on the same OS, you're
    gonna have to get manual.

*reconfigure*::
    Shortcut alias for 'cjdrouted stop && cjdrouted start'.

*start-default*::
    Merges default peers into config before calling 'cjdrouted start'.

*killtunnel*::
    Remove the tunnel named by `cjdinfo tunnel`
